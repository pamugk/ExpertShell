helpText=This app'd help you make an expert system of your own.\n\
  Before using an expert system, you'll just have to fill a knowledge base.\n\
  Each knowledge base stores domains, variables and rules.\n\
  Domain is a set of values of the same type ('String' now is the only supported type).\n\
  Variable a storage location, associated with name.\
  Each variable has to be associated with some domain, so variable could be referenced only to value from that domain.\n\
  Rules define circumstances, in which some value wold be assigned to some variable.\n\
  Assigned value could be referenced both by explicit value or by value of a variable.\n\
  Along with the main elements of knowledge base also shipped set of an environment variables, \
  which are used to setup an expert system behaviour and/or appearance.\
  Currently there is no possibility for changing environment variables' values \
  (wait until version 1.1 to make use of all the environment variables, which are fully compatible with GURU).\n\
  And don't forget to name your knowledge base, so it could be easily told apart from all the others great \
  knowledge bases you would make with this awesome tool :)
